        <p>
            My name is <span class="italic">Sandra Szczepaniak</span> and, privately, I am a proud mom of three
wonderful children, while professionally – a passionate advocate of beauty
and women’s strength. My journey in the beauty industry began in 2016,
when my daughter was just a few months old. At that time, I was searching
for an opportunity that would allow me to balance motherhood with personal
growth and financial independence. That is how my business was born –
something that over time became not only my profession, but also my true
fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2019, I have been running my business and training courses in High
Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK. I am <span class="italic">a certified trainer for Luxury Eye</span>, and
my skills have been recognized multiple times in both online and live
championships. The trophies I have earned proudly decorate my salon,
serving as a reminder that passion and perseverance always lead to
success.
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in delivering accredited training courses, all rigorously
verified for quality and content by Beauty Direct. My mission is not only
to share technical knowledge, but also to inspire women to believe in
themselves and their potential – so that every student leaves my training
with confidence and readiness to achieve her dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still work daily with clients because I believe that, to be an effective
trainer, you must live what you teach, stay up to date with industry
trends, and always remain “in shape.” Thanks to this, I can share not only
theory, but also practical, real-world experience straight from the
stylist’s chair.
        </p>
        <p>
            My motto? <span class="motto"> Beauty is confidence – and confidence opens the door to
everything.</span>
